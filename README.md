# Java Schedule Builder
## Overview:
Java Schedule Builder is a comprehensive scheduling application developed as the final project for an object-oriented web design class in Java. Leveraging Apache NetBeans and Derby, and adhering to UML and three-tier programming principles, the project received a perfect score of 100%.

## User Types:
The application caters to two distinct user roles: admin and student. Administrators enjoy a range of privileges including adding semesters, courses, and students, along with features to display enrolled students for a particular course, drop students, and courses. On the other hand, students can view their schedules, enroll in courses (with a waitlist functionality if the class capacity is reached), display available courses, and drop enrolled courses. Both user types benefit from a convenient change semester combo box, facilitating seamless navigation through semester-specific data.

## Project Status:
Due to an unexpected hardware failure during the developer's time in New Zealand, resulting in the loss of data from their laptop's hard drive, there might be minor bugs in some functionalities. However, the majority of the project was backed up, and efforts to rectify any issues are planned during the upcoming Summer break.

## Dependencies:

Apache NetBeans
Derby
Understanding of UML and three-tier programming
## Future Improvements:
Future iterations of the project may include bug fixes, performance optimizations, and potentially enhanced user interface features based on user feedback.
